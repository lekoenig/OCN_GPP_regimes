# Supporting analyses: Emergent productivity regimes of river networks
R script to apply characteristic, stream-reach-scale productivity regimes (from Savoy et al. 2019: https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11154) to simulated river networks and reproduce the figures in Koenig et al. In Review, Emergent productivity regimes of river networks. 

Optimal channel networks (OCNs) were used to explore emergent network-scale productivity regimes. OCN details can be found in the manuscript text. Please direct questions to Lauren Koenig (lauren.koenig@uconn.edu).

The underlying empirical datasets for this analysis are publicly-accessible from CUAHSI Hydroshare (Savoy 2019): (https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/eba152073b4046178d1a2ffe9a897ebe/).

The R script was written using R (version 3.5.3) and Rstudio (version 1.1.423).
